Using the PluginGenerator

To compile, just type 'make'.

Note: This will produce a plugin in one of the following locations (in order):
1. ../plugins
2. PLUMA_PLUGIN_PATH; using directories in order.

The usage is:
./PluGen (pluginname) (command to run)

(pluginname) is the name of the new plugin.
(command to run) must be at least one word, and is the command to run the 
software that you want wrapped.
This command can use 'inputfile' and 'outputfile' as placeholders for the information
provided in the configuration file when the plugin is actually used.
