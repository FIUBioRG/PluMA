Plugins placed in this folder will be added by default.

## BREAKING CHANGE
Plugins loaded from this folder that are written in C++ are now expected to use
the `.cxx` suffix instead of the `.cpp` suffix. Please update any plugins that
rely on this filetype as support for `.cpp` will be eventually deprecated.
